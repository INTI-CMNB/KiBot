Include Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Draws a table in the PCB from data in a CSV generated by an output. Needs KiCad 7 or newer.
To specify the position and size of the drawing create a group called *kibot_table_X* where
X should match the name of the output. If you don't know how to create a group consult
:ref:`create_group`. Consult the `group_name` option for details. |br|
After running this preflight the rectangle will contain the table with the same name. |br|
Only the width of the table is important, the height will be adjusted. |br|

.. note::
   This preflight assumes that a separated KiBot run generated the outputs
   needed for the tables
.. 

   -  **include_table** :index:`: <pair: preflight - include_table; include_table>`  [:ref:`IncludeTableOptions parameters <IncludeTableOptions_pre>`] [:ref:`boolean <boolean>` | :ref:`dict <dict>`] (default: ``false``) Use a boolean for simple cases or fine-tune its behavior.
