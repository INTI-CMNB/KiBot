Draw Fancy Stackup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Draw the PCB stackup. Needs KiCad 7 or newer.
To specify the position and size of the drawing you can use two methods. |br|
You can specify it using the *pos_x*, *pos_y*, *width* and *layer* options. |br|
But you can also create a group called *kibot_fancy_stackup*. If you don't know how to
create a group consult :ref:`create_group`. After running this preflight the rectangle
will contain the stackup. |br|
Note that the height is not determined by the group height, but by the number
of layers and spacing between layers. |br|

   -  **draw_fancy_stackup** :index:`: <pair: preflight - draw_fancy_stackup; draw_fancy_stackup>`  [:ref:`DrawFancyStackupOptions parameters <DrawFancyStackupOptions_pre>`] [:ref:`boolean <boolean>` | :ref:`dict <dict>`] (default: ``false``) Use a boolean for simple cases or fine-tune its behavior.
