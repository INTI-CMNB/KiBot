Consolidate PCBs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Paste one or more PCBs into an existing PCB.
This is experimental and isn't intended for generating a PCB to work, just for 3D modeling and/or printing. |br|
In the main PCB you just draw text boxes containing a name. Here you map this name to a PCB file name. |br|
After executing this preflight the current PCB contains the references PCBs at the text boxes coordinates. |br|
Only the top left corner of the text box is relevant
