- Draw Fancy Stackup:
  - Micro vias to look closer to real world, they only span 2 layers and they
    must be stacked to span more layers.
- Renderers:
  - Components marked by the exclude filter, or marked virtual, were excluded
    from the 3D models and solder paste processing, but the docs says this is
    just for BoM (See #772)


## [1.8.2] - 2024-10-28
### Added
- Experimental GUI
- Preflights:
  - Draw Fancy Stackup: which includes the type of vias used (#699)
  - Include Table: used to include CSV tables generated by bom/position
    outputs (#702)
- Globals:
  - `dnp_cross_top_layer` and `dnp_cross_bottom_layer`: to control the layer
    where footprints are crossed. (#700 and #622)

- Export Project: problems when downloading KiCad models and trying to compress
  the result.
- PcbDraw: problems with 0 ohms THT resistors (#689)

  - Allow specifying `repeat_for_layer` with empty `repeat_layers`.
    This was the old behavior (i.e. 1.7.0) (#671)
  - Problems with drill marks on KiCad 8.0.4+, which prints them in every
    single layer (even technical ones) (#696)
  - When trying to force a WKS and the project didn't define a WKS.
    The "gui" strategy failed to use the specified WKS
- Draw stackup:
  - Segmentation Fault on KiCad 8 when creating a new group
  - Units not applied when creating a new group
- Expansion of internal field names. KiCad expands "VALUE", not "Value", which
  is what you see in the GUI

- Filters:
  - `separate_pins`: used to create testpoint reports (#638)
  - `_null` can be used to skip the filters processing
- Global options:
  - `use_pcb_fields`: allows using fields defined in the PCB (and not
    only in the schematic), enabled by default (#648 and #650)

- BoM:
  - No color reference when using row colors but not column or kicost colors.
    (#619)
  - "0 pico" for "0"
  - Use of `lcsc_link` as boolean
  - User fields for components that are only in the PCB not filled (#656)
- Worksheet: Size of PNGs that specify its PPI resolution.
- Filters:
  - Problems with filters that change fields for components that are
    only in the PCB. (#628)
  - Use of '_none' filter in lists of filters and _kf()
- Variants:
  - Problems when remove_solder_paste_for_dnp and remove_adhesive_for_dnp are
    both disabled (remove_solder_mask_for_dnp wrongly defined) (#632)

- Generated PCB files: problems with some big structures, like zone fills,
  that could generate huge lines in the generated PCB, not supported by KiCad.
  (#660)

### Changed:
- KiCad 8.0.2: The behavior with hidden text changed in KiCad 8.0.2, it is
  computed even for operations where it isn't really visible, like plotting
  a layer where we don't have the hidden text. So currently KiBot is
  experimentally disabling the "hidden text layer".
  This is a bug in KiCad (https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/17958)
- Render 3D: Modern versions of Image Magick no longer needs two trim passes
  for auto-crop, so now we default to one and an option enables two. (See #644)
- Preflights: The definition of preflight plug-ins changed. They are slightly
  different now. Currently they are Optionable and share more in common with
  outputs. If you need assistance to migrate a preflight just open a GitHub
  issue.
- Outputs: Now all options must declare its default.
- Global `invalidate_pcb_text_cache`: now it changes the PCB on disk, not just
  on memory. This is needed for external tools like KiKit's panelize.
- In many cases now we allow empty lists and use some sort of default.
  A warning is issued, but we continue.
  - Layers: now the default for missing layers is all layers.
  - Copy files: Now we don't stop when nothing to copy is specified
  - Layers: now the default for missing layers is all layers.
  - KiKit Present: Missing description is no longer fatal
  - Any PCB Print/PCB Print: Missing pages/layers is no longer fatal
  - Populate: Missing input file is no longer fatal
  - QR Lib: Missing QR definition is no longer fatal (%p %r used)
  - Blender Options outputs: Make a render when no outputs are specified
  - PCB Print: repeat_layers defaults to inners
  - Spec to Field: some simple defaults for the specs (voltage, current, power
    and tolerance)


## [1.7.0] - 2024-04-23
### Added
- New preflights:
  - erc: a replacement for run_erc when using KiCad 8.
    It can generate ERC reports not only in plain text but also HTML, JSON and
    CSV.
  - drc: a replacement for run_drc when using KiCad 8.
    Also supporting multiple formats and with a modern separation between
    unconnected and warnings.
  - update_footprint: updates one or more footprints from the libs.
    Useful for external QR codes, logos, etc. (#492 #483)
  - draw_stackup: creates a nice drawing for the stackup (See #368)
  - update_pcb_characteristics: updates the text you get from *Place* ->
    *Add Board Characteristics*, so you don't need to remove it and place
    again. (See #384 #368)
  - update_stackup: updates the text you get from *Place* ->
    *Add Stackup Table*, so you don't need to remove it and place
    again. (See #384 #368)
- Global variables:
  - str_yes/str_no: to finetune the *update_pcb_characteristics* preflight.
- Internal templates:
  - ExportProject: creates a ZIP file containing a self-contained version of
    the project. All footprint, symbols and 3D models are included.
- Filters:
  - Now the *var_rename* and *var_rename_kicost* filters can be used to change
    footprints using variants (See #574)
- Quick Start: D/ERC are also included for KiCad 8 (with dont_stop: true)
- Navigate Results: Includes the new D/ERC
- SCH Print:
  - Option to specify a custom page layout (WKS)
  - Workaround for people using backslashes (i.e. Windows+WSL) (See #607)
- PCB Print:
  - Support for (undocumented) KiCad 8.0 worksheets (20231118) (See #607)
  - Control over the LAYER KiCad variable used in worksheets (layer_var ops)
- Internal BoM:
  - Colored rows for HTML and XLSX (See #344)
- Render 3D:
  - Added options to control Eco1/Eco2/Drawings individually on KiCad 8 (#614)

### Fixed
- Netlist generation problems with components on the PCB but not in schematic.
  I.e. logos reaching iBoM output (#598)
- 3D/2D renderers: ranges regex to be more strict. Don't take things like
  "r1-10"
- Sch errors are now caught during output runs. (#604)
- Compress:
  - Could make Python ZIP lib crash when adding a dir to the zip root.
  - So it also removes subdirs created by an output when using move.
- Copy Files:
  - Problems when no target dir and no WKS.
  - Problems when finding the targets (Makefile, copy files, etc.) before
    generating the outputs (or when moved).
- BoM:
  - Expansion of variables in fields could fail if the KiCad config wasn't
    initialized

### Changed
- Filters: When we find a component in the PCB, that is not in the schematic,
  and has a malformed reference, now we inform a warning, discard the
  component and continue. (#604)
- PcbDraw: Now handles panelized boards much faster. Previous code was really
  slow for panels and the time increased exponentially.


## [1.6.5] - 2024-03-31
### Added
- KiCad 8 support
- Panelize: support for all new options (upto 1.5.1)
- 3D/2D renderers: support for ranges in the `show_components` and `highlight`
  options. So one entry can be something like *R10-R20*. Can be disabled
  using the global option `allow_component_ranges`. (See yaqwsx/PcbDraw#159)
- Navigate results: A header and navigation bar (#582)
- BoM: support for SVG format in the logos (#383)

### Changed
- CI/CD: we now filter some warnings that are always generated by docker
  images when we detect a CI/CD environment. They can be enabled using the
  `--warn-ci-cd` command line option. (See #564)
- KiRi: continue even on corrupted schematics (#583)
- Variants: avoid W045 on nameless pads. Assuming they are on purpose and not
  real pads. (See #584)
- BoardView: Skip footprints with no pads (not just REF**)
  (whitequark/kicad-boardview#14)

### Fixed

  (#578)
- Filters:
  - _none filter not always honored (i.e. exclude in BoM) (#580)
  - Rotation for bottom JLCPCB parts with offset (#591)
  - Rotation angle used to compute the offsets, must be the final angle

- Filters:
  - New `_rot_footprint_jlcpcb` internal filter to fix the JLCPCB bottom
    rotations.
  - New options for the `rot_footprint` filters: (See #510)
    - `mirror_bottom`: used to undo the KiCad mirroring of the bottom.

  - Now we generate only for projects, not separated files.
    This avoids problems for sub-sheets in separated dirs.
- Diff:
  - When *check_zone_fills* is enabled now we do a refill for the boards

## [1.6.3] - 2023-06-26
### Added
- General:
  - OS environment expansion in ${VAR}
  - Now outputs can request to be added to one or more groups (#435)
  - PCB text variables cached in the PCB are now reset when the config
    uses `set_text_variables`. This is a complex dilemma of KiCad 6/7
    policy implementation. See
    [KiCad issue 14360](https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/14360).
    (#441)
  - Default values for @TAGS@
  - Parametrizable imports
- Command line:
  - `--list-variants` List all available variants (See #434)
  - `--only-names` to make `--list` list only output names
  - `--only-pre` to list only the preflights
  - `--only-groups` to list only the groups
  - `--output-name-first` to list outputs by name, no description (See #436)
- Global options:
  - `use_os_env_for_expand` to disable OS environment expansion
  - `environment`.`extra_os` to define environment variables
  - `field_voltage` Name/s of the field/s used for the voltage raiting
  - `field_package` Name/s of the field/s used for the package, not footprint
  - `field_temp_coef` Name/s of the field/s used for the temperature
     coefficient
  - `field_power` Name/s of the field/s used for the power raiting
  - `invalidate_pcb_text_cache` controls if we reset the text variables cached
    in the PCB file.
  - `git_diff_strategy` selects how we preserve the current repo state.
    (See #443)
- Filters:
  - New `value_split` to extract information from the Value field and put it in
    separated fields. I.e. tolerance, voltage, etc.
  - New `spec_to_field` to extract information from the distributors specs and
    put in fields. I.e. RoHS status.
  - New `generic` options `exclude_not_in_bom` and `exclude_not_on_board` to
    use KiCad 6+ flags. (See #429)
- Internal templates:
  - JLCPCB_with_THT and JLCPCB_stencil_with_THT: adding THT components.
- New internal filters:
  - `_value_split` splits the Value field but the field remains and the extra
    data is not visible
  - `_value_split_replace` splits the Value field and replaces it
- Internal templates:
  - CheckZoneFill: Used to check if a zone fill operation makes the PCB quite
    different (#431)
  - Versions with stencil for Elecrow, FusionPCB, P-Ban and PCBWay.
  - PanelDemo_4x4: Demo for a 4x4 panel.
- Render_3D:
  - `realistic`: can be used to disable the realistic colors and get the GUI ones

  - `quote_all`: forces quotes to all values in the CSV output. (See #456)

### Changed
- Command line:
  - `--list` also lists groups
- KiCad v6/7 schematic:
  - When saving an schematic the hierarchy is expanded only if needed,
    i.e. value of an instance changed
- List actions:
  - Now you must explicitly ask to configure outputs. Otherwise isn't needed.
    As a result you no longer need to have an SCH/PCB. Use `--config-outs` to
    get the old behavior.
- Git diff link file name:
  - Now we default to using worktrees instead of stash push/pop. As a side
    effect the names of the git points are changed. This is because main/master
    only applies to the main worktree. So the names now refer to the closest
    tag.
- JLCPCB_stencil: Is now just like JLCPCB. The only difference is the added
  layers.

### Fixed
