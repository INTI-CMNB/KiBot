## [1.6.3] - 2023-06-26
### Added
- General:
  - OS environment expansion in ${VAR}
  - Now outputs can request to be added to one or more groups (#435)
  - PCB text variables cached in the PCB are now reset when the config
    uses `set_text_variables`. This is a complex dilemma of KiCad 6/7
    policy implementation. See
    [KiCad issue 14360](https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/14360).
    (#441)
  - Default values for @TAGS@
  - Parametrizable imports
- Command line:
  - `--list-variants` List all available variants (See #434)
  - `--only-names` to make `--list` list only output names
  - `--only-pre` to list only the preflights
  - `--only-groups` to list only the groups
  - `--output-name-first` to list outputs by name, no description (See #436)
- Global options:
  - `use_os_env_for_expand` to disable OS environment expansion
  - `environment`.`extra_os` to define environment variables
  - `field_voltage` Name/s of the field/s used for the voltage raiting
  - `field_package` Name/s of the field/s used for the package, not footprint
  - `field_temp_coef` Name/s of the field/s used for the temperature
     coefficient
  - `field_power` Name/s of the field/s used for the power raiting
  - `invalidate_pcb_text_cache` controls if we reset the text variables cached
    in the PCB file.
  - `git_diff_strategy` selects how we preserve the current repo state.
    (See #443)
- Filters:
  - New `value_split` to extract information from the Value field and put it in
    separated fields. I.e. tolerance, voltage, etc.
  - New `spec_to_field` to extract information from the distributors specs and
    put in fields. I.e. RoHS status.
  - New `generic` options `exclude_not_in_bom` and `exclude_not_on_board` to
    use KiCad 6+ flags. (See #429)
- Internal templates:
  - JLCPCB_with_THT and JLCPCB_stencil_with_THT: adding THT components.
- New internal filters:
  - `_value_split` splits the Value field but the field remains and the extra
    data is not visible
  - `_value_split_replace` splits the Value field and replaces it
- Internal templates:
  - CheckZoneFill: Used to check if a zone fill operation makes the PCB quite
    different (#431)
  - Versions with stencil for Elecrow, FusionPCB, P-Ban and PCBWay.
  - PanelDemo_4x4: Demo for a 4x4 panel.
- Render_3D:
  - `realistic`: can be used to disable the realistic colors and get the GUI ones
  - `show_board_body`: can be used to make the PCB core transparent (see inner)
  - `show_comments`: to see the content of the User.Comments layer.
  - `show_eco`: to see the content of the Eco1.User/Eco2.User layers.
  - `show_adhesive`: to see the content of the *.Adhesive layers.
- Navigate_Results:
  - `skip_not_run`: used to skip outputs not generated in default runs.
- Compress:
  - `skip_not_run`: used to skip outputs not generated in default runs.
- Position:
  - `quote_all`: forces quotes to all values in the CSV output. (See #456)

### Changed
- Command line:
  - `--list` also lists groups
- KiCad v6/7 schematic:
  - When saving an schematic the hierarchy is expanded only if needed,
    i.e. value of an instance changed
- List actions:
  - Now you must explicitly ask to configure outputs. Otherwise isn't needed.
    As a result you no longer need to have an SCH/PCB. Use `--config-outs` to
    get the old behavior.
- Git diff link file name:
  - Now we default to using worktrees instead of stash push/pop. As a side
    effect the names of the git points are chnaged. This is because main/master
    only applies to the main worktree. So the names now refer to the closest
    tag.
- JLCPCB_stencil: Is now just like JLCPCB. The only difference is the added
  layers.

### Fixed
- KiCad v6/7 schematic:
  - Net Class Flags not saved in variants or annotated schematics
  - Repeated UUIDs saved in variants
  - Bitmap scale not saved in variants or annotated schematics
  - `lib_name` attribute not saved in variants or annotated schematics

    SMD components are selected. (See #429)

    variant (project not copied) (#438)

    using legacy file extensions (#446)

- KiCad user template directory autodetection for KiCad 7+

  - KiCad 6 color theme selection.
  - New `pcb_print` output with more flexibility and faster.
- Internal BoM:

    Is named `merge_both_blank` and defaults to true.
  - when a `Value` field can't be interpreted as a `number+unit`,
    and it contain at least one space, now we try to use the text before the
    space. This helps for cases like "10K 1%".
  - `count_smd_tht` option to compute SMD/THT stats. (#113)

  (g200kg/kicad-gerberzipper#11)
- Internal BoM: the field used for variants doesn't produce conflicts. (#100)

  a context not related to variants. I.e. when a `compress` target expands
  `%v`.

- The `%d/%sd/%bd` expansion patterns are now affected by the global `date_format`.
  Can be disabled using `date_reformat: false`. (#121)

  (INTI-CMNB/kibot_variants_arduprog#4)
- Makefile: %VALUE not expanded in the directory targets.
- KiCost variants:
  - empty DNF fields shouldn't be excluded. (#101)
  - problems when setting a field in a variant that doesn't
    exist when no variant is selected. (#105)
- KiCost: list arguments wrongly passed. (#120)
- PCB Print: to show the real name of the PCB file. (#102)
- Compress: not expanding %VALUES in target dirs. (#111)
- Gerber: job file didn't use the global output pattern. (#116)
- Warnings count
- Update XML: Removed the side effect Bom. (#106)
- Problems when using a hidden config file, using an output that needs the SCH,
  not specifying the SCH and more than one SCH was found. (#138)
- 3D: problems to download 3D models for native KiCad 6 files. (#171)
      (not imported from KiCad 5)
- Problems when using page layout files with relative paths. (#174)

    (Do Not Change))
  - Exclude components from the interactive BoM
  - Remove not fitted components from the STEP file
  - Exclude components from the position (pick & place) file
- Default output file name format and default variant can be specified
  from the command line.

  Note you can change it using the variants mechanism.

## [0.6.2] - 2020-08-25
### Changed

    name, sheet title, revision, etc.).
- The filters now accept the following aliases (suggested by @leoheck):
  - `filter_msg` -> `filter`
  - `error_number` -> `number`
  - `regexp` -> `regex`
